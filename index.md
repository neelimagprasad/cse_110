## Welcome to Neelima's GitHub Pages



### Profile

My name is **Neelima Prasad**, and I am a mathematics-computer science major at UCSD. *to skip to my work experience section, skip* [here](https://github.com/neelimagprasad/cse_110/blob/gh-pages/index.md#work-experience)

I am originally from **Los Alamos, NM**, where I lived for over 18 years. It is a beautiful mountain town, with a very small population. I am an amature photographer, and it is a hobby that I've gotten to really explore during quarantine. Here some pictures I took of my town.

## Work Experience
I have worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratory for over 3 years as an intern. I am currently working in crpytography, specifically with lattices. I used to work in astrophysics, where I was a co author on a paper,attached [here](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/485/1/203/5315803/)

One of my favorite quotes that I think ~~really~~ applies to computer programming is: 

> Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration.

Any pieces of informal code I write will be available on my page and can be used and edited using the command `git clone`

I love learning new programming languages. Below are a list of the ones that I am comfortable with, and some that I would like to be more comfortable with by the end of this year. 

- [x] C++
- [x] C
- [x] Java
- [x] Python
- [x] Matlab
- [ ] Javascript
- [ ] Julia
In my [readme](README.md) I state my favorite programming language. 

I am really excited for CSE 110! Some of the skills I am most looking forward to learning/improving upon are
- Working in a manner that is similar to industry
- Learning how to work collaboratively on a coding project 
- Understanding how to not only write code, but write code that others can read and understand easily
